tenyr aspires to be a complete 32-bit computing environment (simulated
architecture, operating system, compiler, utilities). It is very much a work in
progress. An assembler / disassembler (tas), linker (tld), and simulator /
debugger (tsim) exist, a Forth text interpreter is nearly complete, an
implementation has been realised in a Spartan 6 FPGA, and the toycen compiler
project from https://github.com/kulp/toycen is intended to eventually supply
the C compiler component.

To build tenyr, both flex and bison are required. Bison needs to be version 2.5 --
bison 2.4.x will not work.
